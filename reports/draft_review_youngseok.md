#### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?
- I think the team is replicating the experiments from the paper “Why your friends have more friends than you do”, but with different methods of choosing the nodes or edges. I believe this different methodologies yield slightly different outcomes, discussed in class. I think it tries to answer “How does randomly choosing a neighbor edge usually gives higher degree of friends”. However, I think this core question part is somewhat omitted. I think the draft content is more towards the methodology.

#### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?
* I think methodology part is quite clear. However, I think either I misunderstood the question part or the methodologies are trying to answer a different question. 

#### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?
* Yes, the figures are quite clear to understand thanks to the labels and titles. The figures do have all the labels on the axes and captions on the top.

#### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?
I think interpretation part is somewhat weak. There are many experiments and results but I am not  sure where these results lead to.

#### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the 
I think some methods are quite close to the results from original paper, but I think there are some interesting results - the grey lines - that do not quite look like the results from original paper

#### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?
I think the report does have an extension, but I think the motivation linkage from the original experiment is somewhat weak. I believe it is a sensible extension, but I think this can be improved by adding details about the original experiment and how it motivated the team to do an extension.

#### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?
I think all the experiment part is quite complete, but I think defining the core question, and interpreting, analyzing the results can be done further. 

#### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?
The report does use clear, concise, and correct language and it is consistent with the audience. 

#### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 
It is in the correct directory, with correct name. The Markdown format looks great. It has a nice title, but I am not sure the title is fully answered in the content. I like the style of the bibliography
